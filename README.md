# Parts Library

Here we keep design, CAD, gcode, etc. for any parts we design or find for equipment in house. Feel empowered to add a part with a pull request. 

## How to add a part

Add a directory (folder) under `/src` with the part file and a `README.md`. If there is a source file or assets, please add those over a built file.
